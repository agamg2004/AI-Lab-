Objective:
The goal of this lab exercise is to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Artificial Intelligence techniques. TSP is a combinatorial optimization problem where a salesman must visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city while minimizing the total travel cost (distance or time).
This exercise introduces heuristic and optimization techniques such as Brute Force Search, Dynamic Programming, and Genetic Algorithms for solving TSP.

Steps to Solve the Problem:
	Understand the Problem Statement:
	Given a set of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the starting point.

	Formulate the Problem:
	Represent the cities as a graph where nodes represent cities and edges represent the distances between them.

	Choose an Algorithm:
	Brute Force Approach (Exponential Time Complexity)
	Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm) (O(n^2Ã—2^n))
	Heuristic Approach (Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization, etc.)

	Implement the Algorithm:
	Implement the chosen approach in Python.
	Provide a function to read and store distances between cities.
	Develop a function to generate and evaluate all possible routes.
	Optimize the route selection to find the shortest path.

Algorithm: Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm)
Step-by-Step Approach:
1.	Define a recursive function to find the shortest route using memoization.
2.	Use a bitmasking technique to store visited cities efficiently.
3.	Maintain a lookup table (cache) to avoid recomputation.
4.	Iterate over all possible cities and compute the shortest path dynamically.

Code:
import itertools
import numpy as np
N = 4 

distance_matrix = np.array([
    [0, 10, 15, 20],
    [10, 0, 35, 25],
    [15, 35, 0, 30],
    [20, 25, 30, 0]
])

memo = {}

def tsp(mask, pos):
    if mask == (1 << N) - 1:
        return distance_matrix[pos][0] 

    if (mask, pos) in memo:
        return memo[(mask, pos)]
    
    ans = float('inf') 
    for city in range(N):
        if (mask & (1 << city)) == 0:
            new_ans = distance_matrix[pos][city] + tsp(mask | (1 << city), city)
            ans = min(ans, new_ans)  # Update the minimum distance

    memo[(mask, pos)] = ans
    return ans

def main():
    start_city = 0  # Starting from city 0
    optimal_distance = tsp(1 << start_city, start_city)
    print(f"Optimal TSP Tour Distance: {optimal_distance}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
	Test the Solution:
	Use sample city coordinates and distances.
	Run the algorithm and compare the solutions.
