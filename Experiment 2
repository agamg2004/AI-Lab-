Objective
The objective of this exercise is to implement a Robot Traversal Problem using Means-End Analysis (MEA). You are required to:
•	Understand the concept of MEA, a problem-solving strategy that reduces the difference between the current state and the goal state by applying operators.
•	Implement a traversal algorithm where a robot moves from a start position to a goal position in a grid while avoiding obstacles.
•	Develop a Python program that enables the robot to find an optimal path using MEA.

Means-End Analysis (MEA) Process for Robot Traversal
Means-End Analysis (MEA) is a problem-solving approach that:
•	Identifies the current state and goal state.
•	Determines the difference between them.
•	Selects an operator (action) that reduces the difference.
•	Applies the operator and repeats the process until the goal is reached.

Steps of MEA for Robot Traversal
1.	Define the Initial and Goal States:
o	The robot starts at a specific position in a 2D grid.
o	The goal position is defined as the target destination.

2.	Determine the Difference:
o	Calculate the distance between the current state and the goal.
o	Identify obstacles that may hinder movement.

3.	Select an Operator to Reduce the Difference:
o	The robot can move up, down, left, or right.
o	The move should bring the robot closer to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

4.	Apply the Operator and Update the State:
o	Execute the selected move.
o	Update the robot’s new position.

5.	Repeat Until the Goal is Reached:
o	If the goal is reached, stop.
o	If not, re-evaluate the difference and continue.
Algorithm for Robot Traversal Using MEA
Inputs:
•	A 2D grid with 0 (free space) and 1 (obstacles).
•	Start position (x_start, y_start).
•	Goal position (x_goal, y_goal).

Algorithm:
1.	Initialize the grid, start position, and goal position.

2.	While the robot has not reached the goal:
o	Calculate the difference between the current position and goal.
o	Generate possible moves (up, down, left, right).
o	Select the move that reduces the difference and avoids obstacles.
o	Update the robot’s position.
o	Store the movement path.

3.	Output the path taken by the robot.
