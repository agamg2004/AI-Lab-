Objective:
To implement the Water Jug Problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) in Python.

Problem Statement:
Given two jugs with capacities X and Y liters and an unlimited water supply, determine the sequence of operations required to measure exactly D liters using either BFS or DFS.

Operations Allowed:
1.	Fill a jug completely.
2.	Empty a jug completely.
3.	Pour water from one jug to another until the first jug is empty or the second jug is full.

Step-by-Step Experimental Procedure:
1.	Understand the Problem Statement:
o	Given two jugs of specific capacities and a target amount, devise a way to reach the exact measurement.
o	Understand the BFS and DFS approaches to explore possible steps.

2.	Design the State Representation:
o	The state of the system is represented as (A, B), where:
	A = Current water level in Jug X
	B = Current water level in Jug Y

3.	Define the Allowed Transitions:
o	Fill Jug X: (X, B)
o	Fill Jug Y: (A, Y)
o	Empty Jug X: (0, B)
o	Empty Jug Y: (A, 0)
o	Pour water from Jug X to Jug Y.
o	Pour water from Jug Y to Jug X.

4.	Implement BFS and DFS:
o	Use a queue (deque) for BFS to ensure the shortest path is found first.
o	Use a stack for DFS to explore depth-first paths.
o	Track visited states to avoid redundant calculations.

5.	Run the Program with Example Inputs:
o	Example:
Jug 1 Capacity: 4L  
Jug 2 Capacity: 3L  
Target Amount: 2L  

6.	Analyze the Outputs and Compare BFS & DFS:
o	BFS finds the shortest sequence of steps.
o	DFS might not provide the shortest solution but will eventually reach the goal if a solution exists.
